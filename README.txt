#workout project 1

In this workout project we were given the task to print a reverse cypher of the ocntents in a file. 
I first worte input statements that would give us the file directories and then created a function ot begin the reversing process. 
The first part of my function involves opening the read file and then reversing the contents inside the file by pushing the file pointer to the end of the file and then iterating backwards.
I then store the data onto a variable which I then write onto the write file, where the data is stored in the form of a reversed cypher.
